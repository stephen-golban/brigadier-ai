//! Project Brain: the knowledge graph, its retrieval (SQLite FTS5 plus local embeddings),
//! staleness by file content hashes, the Personal Brain, and the full-transcript index rebirth
//! searches (PLAN.md §6 Phase 4).
//!
//! One [`Brain`] per project (`<data>/brains/<project>/brain.sqlite`) and one Personal Brain
//! (`<data>/brains/personal.sqlite`), never in a repository. Every node records its
//! [`Provenance`].
//!
//! Retrieval merges FTS5 (bm25) with embedding similarity by reciprocal-rank fusion, then adds
//! the decisions and conventions linked to what matched. Embeddings come from a local static
//! model ([`Embedder`]); until it is downloaded and loaded, retrieval is FTS5 plus the graph.
//! There is no cloud embedder: Brigadier holds no API keys (a plan note in the README).
//!
//! Threads: every method blocks (SQLite, vector scoring, model loading, downloads). A Brain
//! runs one writer thread and keeps a few read connections; callers on an async runtime use
//! `spawn_blocking` (reads, writes) or a dedicated thread (downloads, backfills). A query never
//! waits for the embedding model to load.
