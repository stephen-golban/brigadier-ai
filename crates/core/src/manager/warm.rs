//! Warm task worktrees: a new worktree gets copy-on-write copies of the dependency installs and
//! build caches the user's checkout already has, so a worker's first build or test run doesn't
//! start from nothing.
//!
//! Best effort throughout: anything that can't be copied safely is left out, and the worker
//! installs or builds it as it would have anyway. Never fails the task. The rule above all
//! others: warming never writes to, renames in or deletes from the checkout, and a copy never
//! gives a worker a way to write into it. When in doubt, the cache is left out.
//!
//! - **What:** git-ignored folders named in [`CACHES`], at the root or in a tracked package
//!   folder (one holding a [`MANIFESTS`] file) up to [`MAX_DEPTH`] folders down. A package
//!   cache is copied only while the worktree's manifest and lockfiles match the checkout's
//!   ([`DEPENDENCY_FILES`]): otherwise its packages would be the wrong versions.
//! - **Never:** Python environments ([`NEVER`], anything holding a `pyvenv.cfg`, or a link to
//!   one). Their scripts point at the interpreter and packages they were made with, so a copy
//!   would keep using the user's own environment.
//! - **Only real folders:** every folder from the checkout or the worktree down to a cache is
//!   reached without following links ([`clone::Folder`]), so a link can't send a copy, a
//!   clean-up or a rename anywhere else.
//! - **Paths back into the checkout:** each copy is checked before it is published.
//!   - Links are resolved fully; one that lands in the checkout is pointed at the same place in
//!     the worktree, and one that leads nowhere drops the copy.
//!   - The files known to hold the checkout's path ([`known_kind`]: package shims and
//!     package-manager state, Cargo's build-script outputs and dep-info, Turbo's logs) are
//!     rewritten to the worktree, in each format's own spelling ([`Style`]).
//!   - Every executable file, every file in a `bin` folder and every small text file is read:
//!     one that still names the checkout means a kind we don't know how to rewrite, and the
//!     whole copy is dropped. So is a copy too big to read within [`MAX_PROBED_FILES`] and
//!     [`MAX_PROBED_BYTES`].
//!   - What this can't see: a binary file (other than an executable) or a text file over
//!     [`MAX_PROBE_BYTES`] that names the checkout. Package managers keep the paths they act on
//!     in text state and scripts, which are read, so the gap is a tool that writes its target
//!     path into a large or binary file at install time. In `target`, compiled programs are not
//!     read either (their debug information always names the folder they were built in); the
//!     ones in a profile folder (`target/debug/app`, the ones people run by hand) are removed
//!     instead, and Cargo rebuilds the workspace's own crates in a new worktree anyway.
//! - **Atomic:** each folder is copied into a temp folder beside its destination, checked and
//!   rewritten there, then renamed into place; on any failure the temp folder is removed. A
//!   destination that already exists is never touched.
//! - **Not mid-write:** a `target` is copied only while every profile's `.cargo-lock` can be
//!   held (and it is held for the whole copy). Other caches are skipped while an install runs in
//!   the checkout or anything at their top (or their package manager's state) changed in the
//!   last [`RECENT_WRITE`]. All of it is checked again after copying, and a copy whose cache
//!   changed meanwhile is dropped. Where a running install can't be seen (Windows), nothing is
//!   copied.
//! - **Bounded:** warming a worktree stops at [`WARM_DEADLINE`], and a copy with more than
//!   [`MAX_ENTRIES`] entries isn't checked; a copy not finished in time is removed.
