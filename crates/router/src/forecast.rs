//! Quota estimates: where each usage window is heading, how hot a provider runs, and what that
//! costs a model's routing score. Pure: the daemon's quota monitor keeps the samples and calls
//! these with the time.
//!
//! - **Rate:** an exponentially weighted average of Δused/Δt over the last hour for windows of
//!   5 hours or less, the last day for longer ones (a window of unknown length counts as short).
//!   Samples are taken as a step function (the monitor stores a value when it changes), so the
//!   value at the start of the look-back is the last sample before it. A drop of more than a
//!   point is a reset and that interval is skipped; smaller drops count as no use, and only a
//!   rise past the highest value since the last reset counts as use (Claude's two reports can
//!   round the same use a point apart, so the reading can flicker 14, 15, 14, 15). Recent
//!   intervals weigh more (time constant: a third of the look-back).
//! - **Forecast:** `projected_at_reset = used + rate × time left`, and "runs out at" when that
//!   passes 100. Absent until the samples span 10 minutes (short windows) or an hour.
//! - **Heat:** Limited when a limit names the window or it is 97% used; Hot when projected at 90%
//!   or 85% used; Warm when projected at 70%; else Cool. A provider's heat is its hottest
//!   provider-wide window (Limited while a limit is set); a window scoped to one model counts only
//!   for that model ([`window_applies`]).
//! - **Penalty:** 0 below a projected 70%, rising smoothly (smoothstep) to [`MAX_QUOTA_PENALTY`]
//!   at 100%. A confirmed limit is never a penalty: routing excludes the model outright.
