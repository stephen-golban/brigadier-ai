// Judges the CI launch smoke check from several judged launches:
//
//   node scripts/judge-smoke.mjs <combined-report.json> <launch-1.json> <launch-2.json> ...
//
// The launches come in pairs: a first launch on a new data folder, then a second launch on the
// same folder. Each report measures the startup budget that fits it (first launch or cold
// start) and marks the other n/a. Each of the two is judged by the median of the launches that
// measured it against the unchanged limit (budget × tolerance): on shared runners most of it is
// the platform creating the window and webview before the page loads, and that swings by
// seconds between otherwise identical launches. Every other check is judged on the first
// launch exactly as the app judged it. All launches
// are printed with their startup milestones, and written to the combined report.
// Runner preparation may delay a launch, but every judged launch is kept.
// There is no retry or best-of selection: a failed launch remains part of the judgment.
